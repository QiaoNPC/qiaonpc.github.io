# Linux Memory Usage - CTF Challenge Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Name**: Linux Memory Usage
- **Category**: PPC / Leet Code
- **Objective**: The objective of the "Linux Memory Usage" CTF challenge is to efficiently manage and process memory usage data for different processes based on given inputs.

## Solution
Encountering a Leet Code challenge within a CTF was an interesting experience. Here's how I tackled it:

1. **Understanding Inputs**:
   - This was my first encounter with a Leet Code style challenge in a CTF context, very very fun.
   - The problem consisted of three types of inputs:
     1. Variables N and Q: Representing the number of processes and queries.
     2. Processes' Data: Including process id, parent process id, and memory usage.
     3. Queries: Containing necessary information for further analysis.

2. **Memory Mapping**:
   - Utilizing the received inputs, I structured the memory by creating a dictionary.
   - The dictionary's key-value pairs were organized to represent parent processes and their corresponding children processes, facilitating efficient data retrieval.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - Processing queries involved reading and parsing the data structure I coded to provide the desired output efficiently.

      ```python
      from collections import defaultdict

      def calculate_memory_usage(p, q):
          children = defaultdict(list)
          memory = {}

          for a, b, c in p:
              memory[a] = c
              if b != 0:
                  children[b].append(a)

          memo = {}
          results = []

          for query in q:
              stack = [query]
              total_memory = 0

              while stack:
                  current_pid = stack.pop()
                  if current_pid in memo:
                      total_memory += memo[current_pid]
                      continue

                  total_memory += memory[current_pid]
                  children_list = children[current_pid]

                  for child in children_list:
                      stack.append(child)

              results.append(total_memory)
              memo[query] = total_memory

          return results

      N, Q = map(int, input().split())
      p = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
      q = [int(input()) for _ in range(Q)]

      results = calculate_memory_usage(p, q)
      for result in results:
          print(result)
      ```

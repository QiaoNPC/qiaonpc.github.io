# Harmonic Secrets - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Harmonic Secrets  
Points: 100  
Category: Cryptography  

## Objective
My objective in the Harmonic Secrets challenge was to decrypt a given ciphertext using the provided key, which I suspected to be a Vigenère cipher. My task was to apply the key and reveal the hidden flag.

## Solution
To successfully complete the Harmonic Secrets challenge, I followed these steps:

1. **Key Analysis**:
   - I began by examining the provided key. Based on the challenge information, I suspected that it was a Vigenère cipher key.

2. **Vigenère Cipher Decryption**:
   - I applied the Vigenère decryption process using the provided key to decipher the given ciphertext.

3. **Flag Discovery**:
   - After successfully decrypting the ciphertext with the Vigenère key, I revealed the hidden flag.

By following these steps and applying the Vigenère cipher decryption, I uncovered the flag.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `petgrad2023{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

In the Harmonic Secrets challenge, my cryptography skills came into play as I decrypted the Vigenère-encrypted message using the provided key to unveil the flag. It was a satisfying experience. Best of luck!

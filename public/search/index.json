[{"content":"MCC 2024 Box CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: MCC 2024 Box Points: 90 Category: Boot2Root Objective: Gain root access to the machine by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Solution To solve the \u0026ldquo;MCC 2024 Box\u0026rdquo; challenge, follow these steps:\nInformation Gathering:\nFirst, obtained the IP address of the target machine and ran an nmap scan to identify open ports.\nThe scan revealed ports 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), and 80 (HTTP) were open.\nPort 21 (FTP) allowed anonymous login, which could be useful for data retrieval.\nAccessing the FTP Server:\nConnected to the FTP server on port 21 and disabled passive mode to list the available files.\nDownloaded a .pcap file from the FTP server for further analysis.\nPCAP File Analysis:\nOpened the .pcap file and analyzed the network traffic.\nDiscovered user credentials (chris and alexander), the domain name, and some WordPress-related endpoints.\nExploring WordPress:\nRan feroxbuster to brute force additional directories, which revealed several interesting files:\nchangelog.md, secret/login.html, xmlrpc.php, and wp-admin.php. Tried logging into WordPress admin and the secret login page using the credentials from the PCAP file, but it didn’t work.\nAttempted SQL injection on the login pages, but it was unsuccessful.\nTried exploiting xmlrpc.php, but that also failed.\nReviewing Changelog for CUPS Vulnerabilities:\nA hint pointed us back to the changelog.md file.\nInside, we found that CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) had 4 CVEs related to it, which might be exploitable.\nAttempting CVE Exploits:\nWe tried several POCs (Proof of Concepts) related to the CUPS vulnerabilities, but none of them worked. Despite trying every known POC available, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t gain further access. Revisiting the PCAP File:\nA hint suggested revisiting the .pcap file for additional clues.\nAfter further inspection, we discovered a port knocking sequence.\nThe sequence was 77, 67, 2024, 631, which was similar to techniques seen in previous CTF challenges like the one in Petronas CTF 2023. The PCAP file showed a failed connection attempt to port 631, followed by a successful connection after the knocking sequence. Performing Port Knocking:\nWe attempted the port knocking sequence by connecting to ports 77, 67, 2024, and then port 631.\nAfter knocking on the correct ports, we were able to successfully connect to port 631, which provided access to the CUPS service.\nExploiting CUPS for RCE:\nUsing an RCE exploit found in a similar writeup on the 0xdf blog, we were able to execute remote code on the machine as the LP user.\nPrivilege Escalation:\nAs the LP user, we found some SUID binaries that could be useful for privilege escalation and escalated to the alexander user.\nDue to the unstable shell, running automated tools like linpeas.sh was not feasible, so we manually enumerated the alexander user’s environment.\nEventually, we discovered SSH keys that could potentially provide further access.\nCracking the Passphrase for SSH Keys:\nAttempted to use the SSH keys, but they were passphrase-protected.\nWe explored notes.txt and tried several password combinations, including those we found earlier (for alexander and LP), as well as MD5 hashes of those values, but none of them worked.\nFinally, we used John the Ripper to crack the passphrase, and successfully retrieved the SSH key’s passphrase.\nGaining Stable Shell:\nAfter logging in as alexander, we finally had a stable shell and could run any tools required for further enumeration but it is not needed in this case.\nWe ran sudo -l and discovered that the user alexander had permission to edit any file on the system.\nWe modified the sudoers file to grant alexander full root privileges.\nAchieving Root Access:\nWith the sudoers file modified, we gained root access to the machine.\nFlag MCC24{h3ll0_fr0m_pr1nt1ng_s3rv1c3s}\nMCC24{4bus1ng_su1d}\nMCC24{g00d_j0b_3v3ry0n3}\n","date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/mcc-2024-box/","title":"MCC 2024 Box"},{"content":"Deepfake Challenge Information Name: Deepfake Points: 100 Category: AI Objective: Analyze the provided .h5 file to retrieve the flag.

Solution Challenge Overview:\nThe challenge revolves around interacting with a Language Learning Model (LLM). The LLM has a distinctive response pattern, frequently saying, \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Hackaday.\u0026rdquo; Failed Attempts:\nI initially tried several payloads to bypass the LLM’s restrictions: DAN: A typical jailbreak payload. Phrasing tasks with overly generic or guarded prompts, e.g.: \u0026ldquo;Great job! You did well protecting the flag.

Solution To solve \u0026ldquo;Lost Memories 1\u0026rdquo;, follow these steps:\nOverview:\n\u0026ldquo;Lost Memories\u0026rdquo; is a series of five challenges related to memory forensics. The challenges can be solved in any order. In this specific challenge, the goal is to determine the time when the memory dump was taken. Analyzing the Memory Dump:\nThe challenge provides a memory dump file. I chose to analyze it using memprocfs, which allows mounting the memory dump as a file system. Memprocfs is useful as it provides a quick overview of the system\u0026rsquo;s processes, files, and other critical components, helping to piece together the system\u0026rsquo;s state. Identifying the Memory Dump Timing:\nTo find when the memory dump was created, I decided to examine the running processes in the memory dump.\nTypically, user-initiated processes are associated with explorer.exe as the parent process, since most user applications are launched from the Windows Explorer interface.\nI searched through the process tree for any unusual processes that could indicate memory dumping activity.\nwinpmem_mini_x stood out as a likely candidate for creating the memory dump.\nFinal Flag:\nThe flag is based on the timestamp of the memory dump, however, at the time of writing this writeup, I have already forgotten whether the flag requires the time to be in +08:00 or +00:00 timezone.

Analyzing the Memory Dump:\nAlthough I used memprocfs in the first challenge for quick analysis, it’s not suitable for dumping password hashes. So, I switched to using Volatility, which is more effective for this specific task. Dumping Password Hashes:\nThere are two primary Volatility plugins used for extracting password hashes: hashdump and lsadump.\nI first attempted the hashdump plugin:\nThis gave me the NTLM and LM hashes of the user warlocksmurf. In case hashdump doesn’t work, lsadump is another option, but hashdump was successful in this case.\nCracking the Password:\nI took the retrieved password hashes and submitted them to CrackStation, an online tool for cracking hashed passwords.

Solution Challenge Overview:\nThe goal is to extract the flag that is generated by the malicious process inject0r.exe. This challenge is part of the \u0026ldquo;Lost Memories\u0026rdquo; series, and solving it requires analyzing how the flag is handled during runtime. Initial Approach:\nI first dumped the process memory of inject0r.exe using strings in hopes of finding the flag directly in the executable\u0026rsquo;s memory. This approach failed. I then dumped the process memory of notepad.exe, which was a child process of inject0r.exe, suspecting the flag would be written there. Unfortunately, this also did not reveal the flag. Running the Binary:\nAfter multiple failed attempts, I decided to run inject0r.exe directly to observe its behavior. Initially, I thought the flag would be written to the notepad application, but it wasn’t.\nInstead, I realized the flag is dynamically stored in memory during runtime, and the address changes with every execution.\nUsing Cheat Engine:\nI launched Cheat Engine for runtime analysis.\nBy searching for the string \u0026quot;flag\u0026quot;, since it was mentioned that the flag would be stored it certain addresses.\nFinal Steps:\nI extracted the base64-encoded flag from memory.\nDecoded the base64 string to reveal the flag.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/lost-memories-4/","title":"Lost Memories 4"},{"content":"Lost Memories 5 CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Lost Memories 5 Points: 500 Category: Forensics Objective: Retrieve notes hidden in the computer of a user named \u0026ldquo;warlocksmurf.\u0026rdquo; Solution Challenge Overview:\nIn this final challenge of the \u0026ldquo;Lost Memories\u0026rdquo; series, the task is to find specific notes hidden on warlocksmurf\u0026rsquo;s computer. The challenge focuses on extracting hidden information, particularly from document files. Analyzing the Memory Dump:\nI began by analyzing the memory dump for relevant files. While exploring, I found some DOCX files, which hinted that the notes could be hidden within these documents.\nSuspecting Macros:\nDOCX files are often used to hide information using macros, so I suspected that the solution could involve extracting and analyzing any embedded macros in the document files. Using olevba:\nI used olevba, a tool for analyzing macros in Office files, to extract and review the macros in the DOCX file. The macros contained the necessary clues to recover the hidden notes. Final Steps:\nAfter reviewing the macros, I found the flag embedded within the macro scripts.\nRetrieved the flag and submitted it in the required format.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/lost-memories-5/","title":"Lost Memories 5"},{"content":"MasterFanumTax CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: MasterFanumTax Points: 100 Category: Forensics Objective: Recover and decode the flag from a Master File Table (MFT) file. Solution Understanding MFT:\nThe Master File Table (MFT) is a crucial component of the NTFS file system. It stores metadata about every file and directory on the system, including attributes such as file name, size, creation/modification timestamps, and file content location on the disk. By analyzing the MFT, forensic analysts can reconstruct file activities, including deleted files and hidden data. Parsing the MFT:\nI used Eric Zimmerman\u0026rsquo;s MFTECmd tool to parse the provided MFT file. This tool is excellent for extracting file names, timestamps, and other metadata from MFT entries. MFTECmd revealed the existence of a file named flag.txt, which likely contained the flag. However, I was unable to retrieve the actual contents of this file using this tool alone. Extracting File Contents:\nTo retrieve the content of flag.txt, I switched to MFTExplorer, another tool by Eric Zimmerman. MFTExplorer allowed me to explore the contents of the MFT in greater detail and successfully retrieve the encoded data from the file.\nDecoding the Flag:\nThe retrieved flag was encoded. I decoded the encoded flag into plaintext, which revealed the correct flag for submission.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/masterfanumtax/","title":"MasterFanumTax"},{"content":"Packman CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Packman Points: 300 Category: Reverse Engineering Objective: Reverse engineer a Python-compiled Windows executable to retrieve a flag. Solution File Enumeration:\nUpon receiving the reverse engineering file, the first step was to enumerate the details. The filename indicated it was a Windows executable due to the .exe extension. Identifying the Binary Type:\nBy running the strings command on the file, I identified it as a Python-compiled executable rather than one compiled with C, C++, or Rust.\nThe presence of Python libraries and mentions of pyc and pyz in the output confirmed this.\nDecompilation Process:\nFor Python-compiled binaries, the typical approach is to reverse it to obtain the original Python code. I utilized pyinstxtractor to extract the .pyc file from the executable. After obtaining the .pyc file, I used pycdc to convert the .pyc back into readable Python code. Flag Retrieval:\nWith the decompiled Python code, I searched through the functions and identified one that would generate or return the flag.\nI executed the relevant function to retrieve the flag.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/packman/","title":"Packman"},{"content":"Sussy Disk 1 CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Sussy Disk 1 Points: 100 Category: Forensics Objective: Analyze the disk image to recover the flag hidden in the web browsing history. Solution Challenge Context:\nSussy Disk is a multi-part challenge series where each challenge involves analyzing different aspects of a disk image. In this first part, we are tasked with finding the flag by investigating web browsing history. Initial Investigation:\nSince this is a Windows-based challenge, I started by checking artifacts related to the default web browser, Microsoft Edge.\nAfter examining the history files for Edge, I found that the few URLs visited were related to downloading Google Chrome, suggesting that Chrome was used for most of the browsing activity.\nGoogle Chrome Analysis:\nNext, I searched for Google Chrome artifacts on the disk. Chrome stores browsing history in an SQLite database located in the user profile directory.\nUsing a tool like DB Browser for SQLite, I navigated to Chrome\u0026rsquo;s History file and extracted the browsing history.\nAfter reviewing the visited URLs, I found the flag embedded in the browsing history.\nConclusion:\nThe flag was hidden in the browsing history of Google Chrome and was recovered by analyzing the browser\u0026rsquo;s SQLite database.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/sussy-disk-1/","title":"Sussy Disk 1"},{"content":"Sussy Disk 2 CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Sussy Disk 2 Points: 150 Category: Forensics Objective: Recover a deleted file from the disk image. Solution Challenge Context:\nThe Sussy Disk series continues with the second challenge, which involves recovering a deleted file from the disk image. Deleted files can often be restored from the Recycle Bin. Understanding $I and $R Files:\nIn Windows, when a file is deleted, it is not immediately removed from the disk. Instead, it is moved to the Recycle Bin, where it is represented by two types of files: $I Files: These are the information files that store metadata about the deleted file, such as the original filename, path, and deletion date. $R Files: These are the actual data files that contain the content of the deleted file. They typically have the same base name as their corresponding $I files. Finding the Deleted File:\nI navigated to the $Recycle.Bin directory on the disk image, where the deleted files are stored. I looked for pairs of $I and $R files to identify potential candidates for recovery. By examining the $R files, I was able to find the one corresponding to the flag. Conclusion:\nClicking on the relevant $R file successfully revealed the hidden flag.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/sussy-disk-2/","title":"Sussy Disk 2"},{"content":"Sussy Disk 4 CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Sussy Disk 4 Points: 400 Category: Forensics Objective: Unzip a password-protected zip file and retrieve the flag. Solution Challenge Context:\nThis challenge is part of the Sussy Disk series, where the main objective is to recover information from various digital artifacts. The fourth challenge involves unzipping a password-protected zip file found in the user\u0026rsquo;s document folder. Initial Investigation:\nUpon searching for the zip file in the documents folder, I quickly identified it but struggled to locate the password needed for extraction. I spent considerable time looking for hints throughout the disk image without success. Reading the Challenge Description:\nAfter several hours, I finally took a closer look at the challenge description, which mentioned that the user frequently utilized PowerShell. This was a critical hint that led me to consider that the zip file might have been created using PowerShell\u0026rsquo;s Compress-Archive cmdlet, which sometimes uses passwords that could be referenced in the PowerShell command history. Finding the Password:\nI accessed the PowerShell console history and searched through it to find any commands that could contain the password for the zip file.\nAfter a thorough search, I successfully located the password used to create the zip file.\nExtracting the Zip File:\nWith the password in hand, I used it to unzip the protected zip file. Inside the extracted contents, I found a base64 encoded message. Decoding the Flag:\nI decoded the base64 message using a decoding tool to retrieve the flag.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/sussy-disk-4/","title":"Sussy Disk 4"},{"content":"Sussy Disk 5 CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Sussy Disk 5 Points: 590 Category: Forensics Objective: Find the flag through various hidden artifacts across the disk.

Finding Part 1:\nThe first part of the flag is located in a file named trojan.ps1.\nI opened this PowerShell script and found an encrypted text.\nAfter decoding the encrypted text, I successfully revealed the first part of the flag.\nFinding Part 2:\nThe second part of the flag was hidden in the Pictures folder.\nIn this folder, I discovered a PowerShell script responsible for encrypting an image file named part2.png by using an XOR operation.\nTo retrieve the second part of the flag, I had to reverse the XOR process. I XORed the encrypted image with the same key to decrypt it, revealing the second part of the flag.\nFinding Part 3:\nThe third part of the flag was located in a text file at warlocksmurf\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\brainrot.txt.\nI navigated to the specified path and opened the brainrot.txt file to find the last part of the flag.\n","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/sussy-disk-5/","title":"Sussy Disk 5"},{"content":"Zelda Phishing Pond CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: Zelda Phishing Pond Points: 200 Category: Forensics Objective: Analyze a phishing email and extract the flag from encoded contents. Solution Initial Analysis:\nThe challenge began with an email that contained encoded contents, which I needed to decode. Normally, files that are sent through email are encoded in base64 format Identify where the files are and decode the files using base64 Decoding Base64:\nUpon decoding the first chunk of Base64, I found that it revealed an HTML page. However, this did not provide any useful information related to the flag. I then moved on to the second chunk of Base64, which resulted in a ZIP file. Unzipping the File:\nAfter unzipping the ZIP file, I discovered a .lnk file (a Windows shortcut). To extract useful information from this file, I used the lnkinfo tool. Extracting Data from the LNK File:\nRunning lnkinfo on the .lnk file revealed that there were Base64 encoded messages contained within it.\nI proceeded to decode this Base64 encoded message, which revealed a PowerShell script.\nFinal Decoding:\nInside the PowerShell script, there was another Base64 encoded message.

Solution To solve the \u0026ldquo;ASCII Hunt\u0026rdquo; challenge, follow these steps:\nInitial Analysis:\nYou are provided with a large Python array consisting of multiple sub-arrays. Each sub-array has a length of 255, and there are 32 sub-arrays. Understanding the Data:\nEach sub-array likely represents a set of ASCII values. Given that a flag is typically around 32 characters long, it is reasonable to assume that the 32 sub-arrays correspond to the characters in the flag. Analyzing the Arrays:\nWent back and forth to the description and eventually found that each sub-array should ideally contain all values from 0 to 255. Identify that some values are missing from these arrays. Finding Missing Values:\nWrite a script to find the missing values in each sub-array. This involves sorting the arrays and determining which numbers from 0 to 255 are absent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import ast file_path = \u0026#39;enc.txt\u0026#39; with open(file_path, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as file: file_contents = file.read() arrays = ast.literal_eval(file_contents) full_range = set(range(256)) flags = [] for array in arrays: array.sort() # Sort the array # Find the missing numbers missing = list(full_range - set(array)) missing.sort() # Sort the missing numbers flags.append(missing[0]) print(\u0026#34;Sorted Arrays: \u0026#34;, arrays) print(\u0026#34;Missing Numbers: \u0026#34;, flags) print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;.join([chr(int(char)) for char in flags])) Constructing the Flag:\nThe missing numbers in the arrays correspond to the ASCII values of the characters in the flag.

Decryption Process:\nFor example, 21 corresponds to \u0026lsquo;R\u0026rsquo;, 26 corresponds to \u0026lsquo;W\u0026rsquo;, and so on.\nUsed this pattern to decode each number in the ciphertext to its corresponding character.\nBut there is a gimmick, I eventually found out that if numbers were less than 30 were being wrapped around.\nThis is a very stupid gimmick to be honest, since the flag cannot be constructed without knowing this.\nFlag Decryption:\nDecrypted the entire ciphertext using the wrapping pattern to reveal the flag. The flag is also in upper-case. Conclusion The Round and Round CTF challenge required understanding a specific wrapping pattern to decrypt the given ciphertext. By recognizing the pattern and applying it to the ciphertext, the flag was successfully decrypted. This challenge demonstrated the importance of pattern recognition and creative thinking in cryptography challenges.\n","date":"2024-03-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/round-and-round/","title":"Round and Round"},{"content":"SimpleLazy CTF Challenge Writeup Challenge Information Name: SimpleLazy Points: 330 Category: Web Objective: The challenge involves exploiting a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability to retrieve a flag.

Utilized DFS templates available from resources like Geek4Geeks to implement the algorithm. Contradictory Challenge Instructions:\nInitially, the challenge instructions seemed contradictory, as it asked to find both the longest and shortest paths for doors. Decided to prioritize identifying the longest path to each door first, considering the logical progression of the problem. Longest Paths for Each Door:\nCalculated the longest path from each door to the exit. For example: Door 1: 6 steps to Exit 10 Door 2: 6 steps to Exit 10 Door 3: 5 steps to Exit 10 Evaluated each door\u0026rsquo;s longest path to determine the shortest length. Selecting Shortest Path:\nChose the door with the shortest path to the exit among the calculated values.
